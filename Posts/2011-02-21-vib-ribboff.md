Vib Ribboff was my submission for the Music Hackday in New York in early 2011.
It is a browser based clone of an old Playstation game called [Vib
Ribbon][vib_ribbon].

It uses the [Echonest API][echonest_api] to resolve beat information off of
[SoundCloud tracks][soundcloud_tracks]. Then it composes a level, matching
obstacles to beats in the song.
