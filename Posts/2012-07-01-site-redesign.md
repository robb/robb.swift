I've been meaning to redesign my website for quite some time now, this weekend
I finally got around. This new design is much more colorful than the old one.

Check out the awesome [symbolset font][symbolset] I'm using for icons. It works
by applying ligatures to whole words, for example 'love' turns into
<span class="ss-icon">love</span>.

I also started to resolve embeds in the client using JavaScript, this makes it
easier for me to publish new blog posts. As a small bonus, the embeds will
usually pick up the color of the surrounding blog post.

<div class="embed rich soundcloud">
    <iframe width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F1557000&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;visual=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;color=E8B50C&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;auto_play=false"></iframe>
</div>

I understand that there are still a couple of rough edges strewn across the
site, I plan to fix those over the coming days. If you notice anything out of
the ordinary, make sure to send me a
<a class="ss-icon" href="mailto:robb@robb.is">mail</a>.
