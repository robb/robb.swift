[Ash] started a new project called [AnyoneCanLearn] after a [particularly bad
experience on StackOverflow][blog-post]. It's meant to be a resource for people
answering questions and those who answer them to maintain positive atmosphere.

He describes its values as follows:

> - Anyone should be able to participate, learn, and teach.
> - Respect others.
> - Do no treat others differently because of their age, gender, sex,
> orientation, ethnicity, ablebodiness, fluency in English, or any other
> personal characteristics.

As someone in a similar position, I've definitely caught myself not giving
people the patience they deserve. This project is a great reminder that we chose
who we want to be and that it is worth the struggle.
