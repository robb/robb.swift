Fresh off the press, [the most recent issue of objc.io][objc.io] is all about
iOS 7.

> Holger Riegel and Tobias Kreß explain the process they went through as they
> upgraded their app to iOS 7. One of the things that’s worth considering when
> redesigning is the addition of UIDynamics, and Ash Furrow shows us how to use
> this in collection views. Chris talks about the new view controller
> transitions API, Mattt Thompson writes about moving from NSURLConnection to
> NSURLSession, and David shows us the new possibilities in multitasking. Max
> Seelemann covers one of the most game-changing features on the new iOS:
> TextKit. Finally, Peter Steinberger will guide us through his favorite new
> things in iOS 7.

phew!
