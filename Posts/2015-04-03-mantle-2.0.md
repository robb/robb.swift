After a long wait, Mantle 2.0 is finally here. I got the opportunity to write
most of the additions and learned a lot from [Justin]'s insightful code reviews.

For those that upgrade, it brings rock-solid error handling and makes it easier
to extend adapters to handle reoccurring transformations. [Check out the whole
Changelog][changelog] for the nitty-gritty. I've been using it in production for
a while, and it being so solid was probably the main reason why the milestone
was stalled at 95% completion for so long.

Sadly, I don't think we'll ever see a Mantle 3.0., now that Swift shows us a
clear way forward in terms of value types and immutability that is not really
compatible with Mantle. It's fundamentally an Objective-C project.

That being said, you should definitely have a look at my buddy [Felix]'
[Pistachio] framework, it shares many of Mantle's ideals and is easy to mix with
specific serialization formats, like [Argo for JSON][pistachiargo].

I hope you find Mantle useful and if you use it production, [I'd be happy to hear
from you][twitter].
