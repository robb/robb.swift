*Hi*, my name is Robb Böhnke, I'm a seasoned software engineer. I live in Berlin.

Enjoy working on the boundary of human and computer interaction – be it in the form of API design, animations or assistive technologies. 

If you would like to get in touch with me, send an e-mail to [robb@robb.is](mailto:robb@robb.is). You can also check out my [GitHub profile][github] or follow me on [Twitter][twitter], if you'd like.

### Notable Contributions
