There is some stunning imagery there, covering the length and breadth of
Triforce of Fractals. It also comes with Mathematica code examples so you can
follow at home, if you've got a copy (I unfortunately don't).

… and cows.

If you're looking for a matching soundtrack,
[R2Bl3nd](https://soundcloud.com/r2bl3nd), who's maybe best known for [his
adaption of Windows 7 x64 Paint.exe][paint], has interpreted an image of the
triangle as a wave file for you:

<div class="embed rich soundcloud">
    <iframe width="100%" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F19846604&amp;show_artwork=true&amp;visual=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;color=EE5500&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;auto_play=false"></iframe>
</div>

There's [another auditory interpretation of the triangle][mp3] at the bottom of
Antonio's page, but that sounds less chiptune and more like a Lovecraftian
Merry-Go-Round.

And now I want Mathematica for Christmas.
