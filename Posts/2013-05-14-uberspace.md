I recently discovered [Uberspace], a pay-what-you-want hosting platform based in
southern Germany. I set up an account (no email required) and after poking
around for a while, I fell in love and decided to migrate my blog over.

I still run a [jekyll] setup similar to the one on GitHub pages, though now that
I have control over the server-component, I also get run all the jekyll plug-ins
I fancy.

Your uberspace comes well-prepared with multiple versions of ruby, node and
python and you're free to install whatever you're missing with [toast].

I'm a bit of a noob when it comes to server administration, but support has been
stellar (being on the same time-zone probably helps) and it  shows that
Uberspace is a labor of love.
