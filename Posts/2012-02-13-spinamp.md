_Spinamp_ is my hack for the [Music Hack Day San Francisco 2012][mhd].

<div class="image">
  <img src='/img/spinamp.png' alt='Spinamp' />
</div>

Inspired by [Lee's earlier work][lee], I recreated the Winamp user experience
on top of the [Spotify Apps API][api].

The playback, shuffle, and replay buttons work and I even had time to add a
custom visualization based on [Steve Wittens' JS1K demo][1kb], that was powered
by a custom FFT event that [Daniel from Spotify][dan] was kind enought to throw
in for me.
