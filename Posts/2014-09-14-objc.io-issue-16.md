The 16th issue of [objc.io](http://objc.io) is out. Appropriately, it's all
about Swift:

> The purpose of this issue is neither to give an introduction to Swift nor to
> present best practices when writing Cocoa/CocoaTouch apps with Swift. For the
> former, there is Apple’s documentation, and many other resources are coming
> up. Regarding the latter, the language is way too young, and none of us have
> had enough experience to confidently talk about best practices.

A recommended read, as always.
