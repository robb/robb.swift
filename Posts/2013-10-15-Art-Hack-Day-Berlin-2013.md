When [Johan] asked me if I wanted to attend [Art Hack Day Berlin][ahd] a couple
of weeks back, I couldn't say no. Johan's got an incredible [track][mhd-berlin]
[record][mhd-reykjavik]  of hack days to his name and this one was no exception.

Under the theme of _Going Dark_, the 50 attendees built some pretty wild stuff,
from a [crowd-sourced burger sculpture][therewillbeburgers] to a robot giving
away your darkest secrets.

Check out this video that does a great job at capturing the vibe of the event:

<div class="embed video vimeo">
    <style type="text/css" scoped>
        .embed:after {
            padding-top: 56.25% !important;
        }
    </style>
    <iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/76620957?portrait=0&amp;byline=0&amp;color=3388CC" width="1280" height="720" frameborder="0" title="Art Hack Day Berlin /// + Going Dark +" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


I'll be sure to take part in the next round in February 2014 as part of
transmediale.
