> I’ve updated my iOS Device Summary to include the new iPhone 6 models.

A handy guide if you need to figure out which devices you need to hold on to for
performance testing or how to complete your collection. Gotta catch'em all.

> of all that lovely screen real estate.

A couple of friends of mine went with the iPhone 6 Plus for this reason. I don't
plan to upgrade my pants size anytime soon so I went with the 6, for now.
